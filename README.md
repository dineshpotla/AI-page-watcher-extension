# Page Change Watcher

A professional Chrome extension to monitor any webpage for changes using LLMs (any model available via OpenRouter). Get instant SMS, email, and desktop notifications when your custom monitoring instruction is satisfied.

---

## Features

- **LLM-based monitoring:** Uses any model available via OpenRouter to analyze full page text with your custom prompt/instruction.
- **Flexible change detection:** You define what to watch for (status changes, keyword appearance, etc.) using natural language.
- **SMS alerts:** Send SMS notifications via Twilio (user-configurable).
- **Email alerts:** (Stub for integration) Add your provider for email notifications.
- **Desktop notifications & sound:** Get notified instantly on your computer.
- **Auto-refresh:** Configurable interval for automatic page reloads and re-checks.
- **Professional UI:** Modern, tabbed popup for monitoring and settings.
- **Secure credential storage:** API keys and settings are stored locally in Chrome, never hardcoded.

## Usage

1. Click the extension icon in Chrome.
2. Enter your **monitoring instruction** (e.g., `Check if 'in progress' has changed to 'success'`).
3. Set the **refresh interval** (in seconds).
4. Go to the **Settings** tab:
    - Enter your **OpenRouter API key** (get one from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)).
    - (Optional) Enable and configure **SMS** and **Email** notifications.
5. Click **Start Watching**.
6. Grant notification permissions when prompted.

The extension will monitor the page, send your instruction and the page text to the LLM (via OpenRouter, using your selected model), and notify you when a change is detected (based on the LLMâ€™s structured JSON response).

## Security

- **API keys are never hardcoded**; users must enter them in the extension popup.
- For production deployments, consider proxying API requests through a secure backend.
- Never share your API keys publicly.

---

## Development

- All logic is in `content.js`, `popup.js`, and UI in `popup.html`.
- Extension uses [Chrome Storage API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/) for settings.
- LLM prompt expects a JSON output:
  ```json
  {
    "changed": true/false,
    "summary": "A brief half-line summary of what changed (or 'No change detected')"
  }
  ```
- Only sends notifications if `changed: true`.
